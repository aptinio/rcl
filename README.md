## CLI Reference

### `rcl review [target]`

Review a PR, a local diff, or uncommitted work.

**Target formats:**
- `owner/repo#N` — GitHub PR number
- GitHub PR URL
- Path to a `.patch` or `.diff` file
- No target with `--staged` or `--working-tree` — review uncommitted changes in the current repository

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--staged` | Review staged changes (`git diff --cached`) |
| `--working-tree` | Review all uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`, staged + unstaged) |
| `--role <name>` | Use a single named role |
| `--roles <names>` | Comma-separated list of roles |
| `--reviewer <model:role>` | Explicit model:role pair (repeatable) |
| `--models <models>` | Comma-separated list of models to use |
| `--context <path>` | Context file or directory (repeatable) |
| `--spec <path>` | Specification file for `spec-compliance` role |
| `--focus <areas>` | Comma-separated focus areas |
| `--post` | Post review as a GitHub PR comment |
| `--json` | Print JSON output to stdout |
| `--json-file <path>` | Write JSON output to a file |
| `--markdown <path>` | Write Markdown report to a file |
| `--ci` | Exit non-zero if critical/important findings exist |
| `--config <path>` | Path to a config file |

`--role`, `--roles`, and `--reviewer` are mutually exclusive. So are a positional target, `--staged`, and `--working-tree` — pick exactly one review source. Untracked files are invisible to `git diff` and therefore not reviewed.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Use explicit model:role pairs
rcl review owner/repo#7 \
  --reviewer claude-opus-4-6:security-auditor \
  --reviewer gpt-5.4:bug-hunter

# Spec compliance review with context
rcl review ./feature.patch --role spec-compliance --spec SPEC.md --context src/

# Output JSON for downstream processing
rcl review owner/repo#99 --json > findings.json

# Review your uncommitted work before committing
rcl review --staged
rcl review --working-tree --roles security-auditor,bug-hunter
```

---

### `rcl review-plan <file>`

Council-review an implementation plan document (PRD, BUILD_PLAN.md, design doc) **before any code exists** — the cheapest bugs to fix are the ones caught in the plan.

```bash
rcl review-plan docs/plan.md
rcl review-plan docs/plan.md --focus risks       # feasibility | completeness | risks | timeline
rcl review-plan docs/plan.md --spec PRD.md       # also check the plan against a spec
```

The plan flows through the normal pipeline — multi-model dispatch, dedup, consensus, agreement-tier report — with plan-adapted prompts. Finding line numbers refer to the plan document's own lines. Categories are reinterpreted for plans (`correctness` = infeasible/contradictory steps, `tests` = missing validation strategy, `best-practices` = process gaps like rollback/migration, …).

Default roles are a plan-suited subset (`general`, `architecture`, `edge-case-hunter`, plus `spec-compliance` when a spec is given); `--role`/`--roles`/`--reviewer` and config `roles` override as usual. Shares `--context`, `--models`, `--json`, `--json-file`, `--markdown`, and `--config` with `rcl review`. `--post` and `--ci` are not offered (no PR to post to; plan findings are judgment calls, not gates).

---

### `rcl discuss`

Ask the models that flagged a finding a follow-up question — one round, reconstructed from a saved report. Useful when triaging: "is this actually exploitable given the sanitizer at line 40?" goes to the reviewers who raised it (especially valuable for **disputed** findings, where the report shows each model's position).

```bash
rcl review --staged --json-file report.json
rcl discuss --report report.json --finding f003 "Is this exploitable given the sanitizer at line 40?"

# Attach code as context, or ask different models
rcl discuss --report report.json --finding f003 --context src/auth.ts "Does the middleware at line 12 not already cover this?"
rcl discuss --report report.json --finding f003 --models anthropic/claude-fable-5 "Summarize the strongest counterargument."
```

Model-generated finding ids can collide; when `--finding <id>` is ambiguous the error lists `<id>:<n>` disambiguators. Findings in the below-threshold appendix are addressable too. Answers come back in parallel, respecting the configured `timeout`, `maxRetries`, and `reasoningEffort`. There is no session state: each `discuss` is one independent round built from the report file.

---

### `rcl roles`

```bash
rcl roles list             # List all built-in roles
rcl roles show <name>      # Show system prompt and details for a role
```

---

### `rcl converge-attempt`

Durable launch telemetry used by the generated `rcl-converge` skill. Each call
atomically records one per-target attempt under the repository's common Git
directory, so the count survives sessions, linked worktrees, and abrupt system
restarts. Every valid claim is recorded regardless of the accumulated attempt
count; counts never stop a healthy convergence loop or require renewed consent.

Full-fleet reviewer completion is not required. For the generated
`rcl-converge` skill, let `N = stats.totalReviews`; a round is conclusive only
when `stats.successfulReviews >= max(2, ceil(2 × N / 3))`. Every timeout or
error must be disclosed, and a result below that threshold is inconclusive.

Exit code 3 means attempt accounting itself failed (state, lock, Git,
filesystem, or another infrastructure error). With `--json`, failures are
emitted as structured JSON on stderr. If the attempt is durably recorded but
final lock release fails, the claim still succeeds with a warning so retrying
cannot record the same intended launch twice.

The short accounting mutex is fully written as a private owner file and then
published with an exclusive hard link, which cannot replace an existing file
or legacy directory. State contents and, where supported, their directory
entry are synced before a claim succeeds. A dead owner is isolated through a
token-scoped hard-link tombstone before another claimant can proceed; inode
checks make that tombstone safe to remove after reclamation. Invalid or legacy
ownerless locks fail closed, and timeout errors include the manual recovery
path. When upgrading,
an evidence ledger seeds only its highest recorded round: historical failed or
missing-report launches cannot be reconstructed, while every claim after the
machine state is created is counted exactly. The state remains a same-user
local safety mechanism, not a tamper-proof store: deliberately deleting
`.git/rcl-converge-attempts` discards telemetry and is unsupported. Historical
state containing a `cap` field loads in place and continues uncapped. The old
`--max-attempts` option is accepted as an ignored, hidden compatibility no-op;
it cannot reinstate a stopping boundary.

```bash
rcl converge-attempt --target owner-repo-123
```

---

### `rcl converge-report` and `rcl converge-verdict`

The cross-round memory of a converge run, persisted in
`.git/rcl-converge-runs/<target>.json`.

`converge-report` dedupes one round's report JSON against every prior round of
the run using a location-anchored finding identity (hash of file + category +
line bucket, plus a line-overlap matcher — titles are deliberately ignored:
models rephrase ~98% of them between rounds). Each finding is classified
`new`, `repeat`, `suppressed` (previously dismissed — a dismissal is terminal
on its evidence and fresh corroboration alone never reopens it), or `regating`
(previously dismissed at non-critical severity, now sighted as critical —
genuinely new evidence). The call enforces strict contiguous round sequencing
but no numerical stopping limit. Historical state containing `roundCap` loads
in place and continues uncapped. The old `--max-rounds` option is accepted as
an ignored, hidden compatibility no-op; it cannot reinstate a stopping
boundary. State and sequencing failures exit 3.

`converge-verdict` records triage outcomes per finding identity —
`--fixed <key>` and `--dismissed '<key>=<reason>'` (both repeatable) — which
drives later-round suppression and accrues the per-model precision history.
Once every gating identity of the current round is triaged, it also reports
the round's resolution: `converged-dismissal-only` (everything dismissed,
nothing fixed — the round converges on the spot, no confirmation round),
`fixes-pending-fresh-round`, or `unresolved` with the identities still open.

```bash
rcl converge-report --target rcl-30 --report report-r2.json --round 2 --json
rcl converge-verdict --target rcl-30 --round 2 \
  --fixed 9787c6ea72ae778c --dismissed 'd2baf9675eb450f0=guard already exists'
```

---

### `rcl models`

The tool's own memory of which reviewers earn their seat. Every reviewer call
and every `converge-verdict` outcome accrues in a cross-run store at `~/.rcl`
(`RCL_DATA_DIR` overrides; deliberately not under /tmp, so history survives
converge-state cleanup). `rcl models` prints, per model over a trailing 90-day
window: triage precision (share of its supported findings the converge loop
verified and fixed rather than dismissed), triage volume, call volume,
dead-call rate, p50 latency — and the consensus **weight** the model earns:
`0.5 + precision`, clamped to [0.5, 1.5], neutral (1) below 20 triaged
outcomes. Weights scale each model's consensus vote in report confidence and
in consensus gating, so persistently noisy models lose gating power
automatically; the applied weights are visible per finding
(`consensus.weightedScore` / `consensus.modelWeights`) and per run
(`stats.modelWeights`) in the report JSON.

```bash
rcl models                       # table over the trailing 90 days
rcl models show --window 30 --json
rcl models seed --from ~/recovered-rcl-artifacts   # backfill from reports + converge ledgers
```

## Config File

Place `.review-council.yml` in your project root (or any parent directory). All fields are optional.

```yaml
# Blocking council (provider-prefixed names) — every round waits for these.
# Shown here: the actual defaults. Keep slow/aggregator-routed models out of
# this list; give them an async seat instead.
models:
  - anthropic/claude-fable-5
  - openai/gpt-5.6-sol
  - google/gemini-3.6-flash

# Async bonus reviewers — fired with each round, never awaited. Results that
# have arrived by the next round of the same target are merged into that
# round's dedup and marked `async` in the report JSON.
# Any model on https://openrouter.ai works — keep the vendor segment after the prefix.
asyncModels:
  - openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k3

# Default roles to run
roles:
  - security-auditor
  - bug-hunter
  - test-coverage

# Or pin explicit model:role pairs
reviewers:
  - model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6
    role: security-auditor
  - model: openai/gpt-5.4
    role: bug-hunter

# Custom role overrides (extends a built-in or creates new)
customRoles:
  - name: my-style-guide
    focus: [best-practices]
    systemPrompt: |
      Enforce our team style guide. Flag any deviation from snake_case
      variable names and require docstrings on all public functions.

# Consensus and deduplication thresholds
thresholds:
  minConsensusScore: 0.4   # 0–1; findings below this are demoted to the appendix
  minConfidence: 0.2
  dedupeLineWindow: 5      # lines within which findings are merged
  jaccardThreshold: 0.3    # weighted title+description similarity threshold for dedup

# Convergence gating: which findings block convergence / CI (RCL-23).
# A finding gates when multi-model, critical, or unrefuted by a cheap
# verification pass; refuted single-model claims stay in the report but
# stop blocking. Report JSON marks every finding with gating.reason
# (consensus | critical | verified | none).
gating:
  mode: verified-consensus        # or all-findings (legacy: severity alone decides)
  minModels: 2                    # distinct models for consensus gating
  verificationModel: google/gemini-3.6-flash  # direct-API only
  verificationTimeout: 60000      # ms for the single batched refutation call

# Output defaults
output:
  markdown: true
  markdownPath: review-report.md
  belowThresholdAppendix: true  # false drops below-threshold findings outright

# Concurrency and reliability
concurrency: 6
timeout: 300000       # ms per blocking model call (every direct-API p90 is under 260s)
asyncTimeout: 900000  # ms per async-lane call (slow reasoning models get headroom; nothing waits on them)
# quorumFraction: 0.75  # round closes once this share of calls has completed; stragglers
                        # are canceled and recorded (core `models` are never canceled).
                        # Default: exactly 2/3 — leave unset for that; 1 disables.
maxRetries: 3

# Reasoning budget for providers that support it (currently OpenRouter).
# low | medium | high — default medium. Unbounded reasoning makes these
# models spend the whole completion budget thinking before they answer;
# raise to 'high' for deeper review at the cost of latency and tokens.
reasoningEffort: medium

# Context files to attach to every review
context:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md
  - docs/api.md

# Spec file for spec-compliance role
spec: SPEC.md

# GitHub token (prefer GITHUB_TOKEN env var instead)
# githubToken: ghp_...
```

Supported config file names: `.review-council.yml`, `.review-council.yaml`, `.review-council.json`, `review-council.config.js`.

Before dispatch, RCL prints the expanded reviewer × chunk call count,
concurrency, wave count, timeout, and timeout-bound queue estimate. Interactive
runs update the spinner; redirected runs emit periodic heartbeat and bounded
completion lines with status counters, so a long queue is distinguishable from
a hung process.

## How Consensus Works

When multiple models and roles review the same diff, their findings are:

1. **Deduplicated** — findings on the same file and overlapping line range are grouped by weighted title+description token similarity; findings in different categories can still merge, but need stronger similarity (models disagree on category boundaries constantly). Findings whose line ranges strictly overlap and that name the same issue concept (sql injection, IDOR, hardcoded secret, …) merge regardless of wording — models phrase the same issue too differently for token overlap alone. Repeats within a single review are collapsed first. Findings that clearly reach opposite conclusions are kept as separate, disputed findings; subtler contradictions merge but are flagged as disputed.
2. **Scored** — each group receives a consensus score based on three dimensions: reviewer diversity (how many distinct models and roles flagged it, saturating at half the fleet so large configurations aren't penalized), role relevance (whether a role specialised in that finding type confirmed it), and isolation (what fraction of relevant reviewers flagged it).
3. **Classified** — groups are assigned a confidence band (Very High → Minimal) and a final severity. Severity is the most common rating across reviewers; when reviewers disagree, high-confidence agreement elevates it, but only to a severity at least two reviewers independently assigned — a lone outlier rating is surfaced as a dispute instead. Each group also gets an **agreement tier** measured over distinct models — `unanimous` (every successful model), `majority` (at least half), `minority` (2+, under half), `single` (one model) — because roles share a model's blind spots, so model count is the evidence axis.
4. **Filtered** — groups below `minConsensusScore` or `minConfidence` are demoted (blocking severities are never dropped). Demoted findings land in a collapsed "worth checking" appendix at the bottom of the report and in the JSON `belowThresholdFindings` field — never in severity totals or CI gating. Set `output.belowThresholdAppendix: false` to drop them outright instead.

The report is organized by agreement tier — unanimous first, then majority, minority, **disputed** (reviewers reached materially different conclusions; rendered as per-model positions so you can judge), and single-model last. Within each tier, findings sort by severity. The tier structure is the point of a multi-model council: it tells you which findings are independently confirmed and where to spend your own judgment.

For the full algorithm, see [CONSENSUS_V2_SPEC.md](./CONSENSUS_V2_SPEC.md).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Claude models |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | API key for OpenAI models |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API key for Google Gemini models |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | API key for [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) models (`openrouter/…` prefix) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token (PR fetch and post) |
| `RCL_DEBUG` | Set to any value to print full error stack traces |
| `RCL_NO_HARNESS_KEYS` | Set to any value to disable Harness key distribution (below) |

The default blocking council is direct-API only (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) —
no default review round ever waits on an OpenRouter-routed call. The default
async lane holds one OpenRouter-hosted bonus reviewer (`kimi-k3`); if
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is not set, it is dropped from the defaults with a warning
(models you configure explicitly still fail loudly instead). Note that when the
key is set, default reviews send diff and context content to OpenRouter — an
aggregator and an additional data processor beyond the direct model providers —
as well as to Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. Configure `models:` and
`asyncModels:` explicitly if that matters for your repository.

### Key distribution via Harness

Repos that carry a committed `.harness-cli/config.json` (discovered git-style,
walking up from the working directory) can get their provider keys from a
[Harness](https://harness.infra.one) backend instead of every teammate managing
them by hand: run `harness login` once, and any provider key **missing from the
environment** is fetched from `GET /api/v1/model-keys` on the host that minted
the stored login token, and injected for the run.

- Environment variables always win — only missing keys are injected.
- The stored credential is only ever sent to the host it was minted for, never
  to a URL named by the repo's own config (untrusted input in a cloned repo).
- Any failure — not logged in, offline, older backend without the endpoint —
  falls back silently to the plain-environment behavior above. The fetch runs
  under a 3-second timeout and keys are never written to disk or logs.
- Which providers the backend serves is server configuration
  (`HARNESS_MODEL_KEYS` on the backend); `RCL_NO_HARNESS_KEYS` disables the
  whole mechanism client-side.
